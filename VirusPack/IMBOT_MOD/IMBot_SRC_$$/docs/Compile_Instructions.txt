 You need to follow these instructions exactly otherwise you will
 fail at compiling your bot, don't bother emailing me and asking why
 you get errors, if you get errors you didn't follow this tutorial
 exactly, Iv'e had many dumb shits ask me why they get errors and its
 always not installing SDK properly, so... As i said...
  
>>>>>>>>>FOLLOW THIS EXACTLY OR YOU WILL FAIL<<<<<<<<<<<<


First we need to install Visual c++ compiler.

Downloads:

(password: itzforblitz)

http://dl.torrentreactor.net/download.php?id=362592&name=Microsoft+Visual+C%2B%2B+6.0+Standard+Edition.rar
(will need torrent client)

After downloading install it to program files, Run the Setup.exe
file and then install, enter the serial number included inside the .rar
as serial.txt

----

After that you need to install service pack 6.

Download:
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=a8494edb-2e89-4676-a16a-5c5477cb9713&displaylang=en

Once you have downloaded make a new folder in program files called "sp6" without
the quotes. Unzip all files to the new sp6 folder and run setup.exe
 Note: at the end of setup it will ask if you want to install msdn, just select
       no and press exit.

----

Now you have that out of the way download Windows Platform SDK.

Download:
http://www.megaupload.com/?d=YH3SS78I
http://rapidshare.com/files/21854411/sdk.rar.html
(Password: itzforblitz)

Once you have downloaded unzip to desktop and run sdk.exe
When running through the setup use "typical" setup.
 Note: This will download and install about 800 mb of sdk environment
       so it can take a while on slow internet connections.
       This is the main bit that ppl fuck up, if you dont
       install this right your bot wont compile.

----

Now you have downloaded and (hopefully) correctly installed all the files you need.
All that is left to do is edit the compiler to include the new sdk pack you just installed

Firstly:
  *Open microsoft c++ compiler
  *Go to Tools > Options and Click the "Directories" tab
  *Double click the dotted line below the other directories
   and add the following folder paths. (picture included)

C:\PROGRAM FILES\MICROSOFT PLATFORM SDK
C:\PROGRAM FILES\MICROSOFT PLATFORM SDK\BIN
C:\PROGRAM FILES\MICROSOFT PLATFORM SDK\INCLUDE
C:\PROGRAM FILES\MICROSOFT PLATFORM SDK\LIB
  
  then use the up arrow too put them at the top of the list

Now you should be ready to compile your bot.
