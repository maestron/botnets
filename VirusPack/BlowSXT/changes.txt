Nils (03/31/04):

- Changed the file copying in rBot.cpp due non working dcom. 
- Changed the silent indication for the tftpd to true
- Added a TFTP File start event.

---

Nils (03/30/04):

- Added:
   - WebDav Exploit
   - Optix Exploit
   - DCom2 Exploit

- Added 2 new Channelvariables "exploitchan", "snifferchan". (configs.h/externs.h/rBot.cpp)
  Changed dcom1 and upnp. Added Loco's new Shellcode.

Racerx90 (03/29/04):

- Fixed ntpass/netbios code. Removed debugging messages. Added a static
  list of userids to try to brute force attack when enumusers fail.
  Also added in an option to check for a file exists to randomly generate
  a new filename and re-try to copy. Removed payload option as it's not
  needed, instead copying local filename. Enuming of shares still needs
  to be written. (ntpass.cpp/h)

- Made log listings threaded to prevent pinging out the bot on long
  lists. Added thread id for log listings. (aliaslog.cpp/h/threads.h)

- Made a central exploits statistics system to all for dynamically
  generating a stats list. Now hooked into exploit list. 
  (advscan.cpp/h/rbot.cpp)

Racerx90 (03/28/04):

- Added auto-start of tftp and http servers to advscan. Added an entry
  in the structure to allow for auto-start up. Uses GetModuleFilename
  as if you use rndfilenames and don't do this the file won't be found.
  (advscan.cpp/h)

- Added net send command to send a message to the local system account.
  (net.cpp/h/rbot.cpp)

- Added option for http server to use for exploits only. Added an
  option to turn of directory listing so file transfers (infecting) can
  only take place. (httpd.cpp/h)

- Working on removing global variables from http server code. Not finished
  yet (see commented out code.) (httpd.cpp/h)

- Added silent option support for tftp server code. This comes in handy 
  for when being used with an exploit. Still notifies log that file has
  been completed. This will prevent excessive channel flooding. 
  (tftpd.cpp/h/rbot.cpp)

Racerx90 (03/25/04):

- Added "File transfer complete to IP: x.x.x.x" message to tftp server. Used
  recvfrom() call to get peer IP from SOCKADDR_IN struct. (tftpd.cpp)

- Added SQL exploit (cleaned redundant code and tighted up.) Additional
  error checks were put in place and the code now will try to hack the
  passwords by going through the password list. (mssql.cpp/h)

- Fixed Exploit messaging structures. These need to be locally passed not
  globally like they are not. It's 1 variable "extra" per function, please
  do this from now on.

- Added searchlog() call to for searching through the bot's log to 
  monitor/check for events to happen. Used for exploits. (aliaslog.cpp)

- Added lstrstr() (caseless strstr()), used for searchlog() and showlog()
  calls. (misc.cpp/h)

- Added error message on failure to open file for tftpd. Also fixed ordering
  of bind() to fopen() calls on the tftp server routine. (tftpd.cpp)

---

Racerx90 (03/24/04):

- Enabled level 4 warnings on compiler and worked on cleaning poor coding
  practices all over the place. Cleaned a magnitude of SEVERAL hundred 
  typecast/assignment/pointer/use without declaring issues. There are still 
  some left, I honestly got tired of fixing the code. Touched every *.cpp file.

- Added in additional prototypes and function loading for new calls being
  used. (loaddlls.cpp/h/functions.h)

---

xwarlordx (03/24/04):

- Testing out the ICMP/UDP/IGMP functions aswell, wrote them, but
  didnt tested them that well. When done will send update (PVT)
  IGMP looks pretty powerfull to me.

- Fixxed the ddos, packets are now really 32 byte, and we're
  able to use ack packeting now. (ddos.cpp/synflood.h/rbot.cpp)

- Checked out upnp, didnt do anything. Will need a rewrite i think 
  (upnp.cpp/.h)

- Testing the winlogon hooker. Not added to current version. Got it XP
  compatible (XP bypasses gina when it runs ''xp home'' (no network)) - private

---

Loco (03/24/04):

- tftp now automaticly starts when exploiting with dcom

- Added transfer started message to tftp *FIX IP SHOWN* 
  Note: RacerX90: This doesn't work, will fix later.

- Fixed dcom to support port 445/1025 *FIX THIS*

- Saved some lines in upnp.cpp
  Note: RacerX90: This needs to be finished, code is not complete.

---

RacerX90 (03/24/04):

- Removed redundant ResolveHost() call (fphost.cpp)

- Removed inline #include "fphost.cpp" and fixed right.

- SetErrorMode() to hide system messages on crashes (rbot.cpp)

- Converted all new *.cpp files from below to use dynamic loading of
  function calls instead of being statically linking. Most use 'f' in
  front of call name. Check loaddlls.cpp/h for details. 

- Added new exploits to code base, everything now builds with recent
  code re-write (03/22/04).

- Removed non-standard xWrite, xRead, xClose calls and replaced them
  with the real send, recv, closesocket calls. This makes more sense to
  keep the calls unified not mixed up and non-standard. (all new exploits)

- Fixed "gethost" command to issue command to the specified hosts (rbot.cpp)

- Fixed processes.cpp to allow for full or partial filename listing
  on process list. (rbot.cpp/processes.cpp)

- Added new privilege command to allow for raising privs to obtain
  system process info. (processes.cpp/h)

- Added several new commands to loaddlls.cpp/h for support of new
  exploits and new process listing code (loaddlls.cpp/h)

- Removed old ntscan functions, no longer needed with new scanner. (rbot.cpp)

- tftp fix for bogus file name crash (tftp.cpp) Error code still needed to
  be added.

- Fixed the problem of removing the critical section during multiple scans.
  I over looked this when adding multiple scan support code (caused the bot 
  to crash) (advscan.cpp)

- Added DNS flush call/command and code to irc connect. (netutils.cpp/h/rbot.cpp)

- Added ARP flush call and command. (netutils.cpp/h/rbot.cpp)

- Add new thread ID entries for file find and process list (threads.h)

- Threaded process listing to prevent pinging out (processes.cpp/h/rbot.cpp)

- Added find file stop and process list stop (rbot.cpp)

- Fixed bug in thread ID for findfile thread (rbot.cpp)

- Reset socket info in killthread() (threads.cpp)

- Added new function clearthread() to clear away old thread information 
  when a thread closes (threads.cpp)

- Temoved redundant thread clearing code in almost ALL threaded function call
  with clearthread() (touched almost all *.cpp files)

- Added findthreadnum() call support to .currentip code as a "default" 
  return option if no thread is specified. (rbot.cpp)

- Added numerous "FIX ME" statements throughout the code for more problems 
  identified with code, including memory leak in psniff.cpp, line truncation
  problem in rbot.cpp, etc..

- Log function supports full listing, filter searching, or number of entries
  options. (aliaslog.cpp/rbot.cpp)
