[2.0]
- [2.1] CONFIGURING

1. Open current/tools/other/crypto.exe
2. Choose "xor + hex §_§".
2. Set the XOR key to the same as in config.h (969), where it says "231".
If you choose to change the XOR key in config.h, you will have to change
all the encrypted strings in the source.
3. Write the text you want the program to encrypt for you, where it says
"value", and add it to config.h.
4. For Username and Password use the "elf hash  ~_~" option.


- [2.2] COMPILING

1. Get and install Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0.
2. Get and install Visual Studio Service Pack 5 (*).
3. Get and install Visual Studio Processor Pack (**).
4. Get and install Platform SDK (***).
5. Get and install WINDDK (****).
5. Open Visual Studio and open:
