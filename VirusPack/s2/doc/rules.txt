-----------

1. do not ever tell anyone about this site and group. 
2. do not ever leak any shit to any person outside of group. 
3. any exe's that you compiled from this source code is for your use only.
4. exe's should be kept to yourself.  
5. if you have friend who wanting to give you bots. give them your other bot like sdbot. 
6. I may add more rules here.   


results of not following those rules: 
being wonked for life from us.
your sites will be reformated.  


error reporting:
-------------------

1. Don't report a bug if the programmer cannot reproduce it (we already have enough bugs to search where we can reproduce the bug)
2. Don't report a error where you don't have debug information (debug build) or debugger output (release build) or line numbers
3. I (wonk) will not process any bug reports about bots behaving strangely on unrealircd and any mods of it (only if some bugs were fixed)
4. Read the FAQ and the Reference before asking any questions !!!
5. Error reports that result of people not following these rules will be silently ignored.
