Please look at the original PCRE documentation in pcre-3.9/doc for more
information on PCRE including regular expression details.

BigPcre C++ Wrapper

OK, so I've also written yet another PCRE C++ wrapper (see my last Regex
article). If I had known about Zopyra, I might have just ported it over to
Windows instead, but I've already done this. I've done comparison
benchmarking as well but that's the subject of the next article. The library
contains PCRE as well and has only been tested on Windows though I've tried to
keep to the standard as close as possible (I'll try to test it on Linux and
FreeBSD in the future). The source is here: bigpcre-0.91.zip (453K).  I've
written some notes on the implementation, follow the link. 

First, I'd like to thank Philip Hazel, the author of PCRE, for such an
excellent library and the generous license.

An example (from simple_example.cpp):

    try {
        const char* s = "ffoobarfoooobarFOFUM";

        Pcre::regex re("fo+", "/i");
        Pcre::match m = re.match(s, strlen(s), "/g");
        std::copy(m.begin(), m.end(), Pcre::ostream_iterator(std::cout, "\n"));
    }
    catch (Pcre::pcre_error& e) {
        std::cerr << "Pcre error: " << e.what() << "\n";
    }

I find this much simpler than the C source to do this and that's why I wrote
it. Things to note about this library (I compare to Perl since it is the
reference, but the notes are relevant for other regex libraries you are
familiar with (probably) since the syntaxes tend to be similar): 

  * It is in the Pcre namespace. I wanted to use pcre but the symbol was
    already taken by the PCRE C library. 
  * I've added the convenient "/g" and "/G" options from pcretest example.
    There are actually two regex::match() functions because of this. The
    first, as shown above, returns a Pcre::match object which flattens all
    matches with the "/g" and "/G" options. The second, regex::matchv()
    returns a vector<Pcre::match> object with each "/g" or "/G" match as a
    slot in the vector. You can still use this function for consistency
    without "/g" or "/G" and the vector will be of size 0 or 1 depending on
    whether there was a match or not. 
  * The constructor and match functions take options as a string like Perl.
    There are enums defined in pcre.hpp but there are no functions that take
    them. I feel that this is consistent with Perl usage and is easy to
    remember. Please note that some options can only be taken at compile time
    and some only at match time. The slash ('/') at the beginning of an option
    string is optional. 
  * There are Perl inconsistencies, please see the documentation
    (bigpcre/pcre-3.9/doc/pcre.html) for the details. The header, pcre.hpp,
    and the bigpcre documentation show which options match to which strings. 
  * I've added a simple substitution convenience function,
    regex::substitute(). This does not support back references, another thing
    to add in a future release. 
  * This was a difficult decision, but the functions take C-style strings
    rather than std::string's. This was because of efficiency, I will need
    this with C libraries and when parsing big files, it is often faster to
    use read or other C library functions. 
  * Related to the point above, the match object returns a pair of indices to
    the original string passed in. It also keeps a copy to the string pointer
    and uses this for the convenience function
    match::const_iterator::to_string() (and the associated cast to
    std::string), this is potentially dangerous because if the original string
    memory goes away, this will result in a runtime error.  This is another
    reason not to use strings for the function signatures, it would be easy to
    do something like this: re.match("this will blow up if you subsequently
    use the to_string() function in the match object returned") 
  * I rewrote pcretest and pcredemo from the C library to use the C++
    wrappers. I've reran all tests (pcre-3.9\testdata\testinput*) and
    confirmed the results with the C version of pcretest. There are some
    differences in formatting (use diff -b) and some result differences
    because I didn't support all pcretest escape sequences ('+', 'I', 'D',
    'M').

Some notes on the physical implementation: 

  * The MSVC Makefile (nmake) is Make_mvc.mak. It will build both the C and
    C++ versions using Windows multi-threaded DLLs (-MD) as static libraries
    (.lib's, no dlls). Change this if you want something different. My
    development environment is Windows2K with both VC6 and VC7. 
  * The C PCRE-3.9 source is in the subdirectory pcre-3.9, the make will build
    both libraries, pcre.lib and pcrexx.lib. pcrexx.lib includes all of
    pcre.lib and can be linked directly into C programs and should be all you
    need. Since these are static libraries you shouldn't lose any space. 
  * To use the C++ library, you will only need pcre.hpp, the main header file.
    To use the C library, include pcre-3.9/pcre.h. 
  * The ported test programs are there: pcretest.cpp and pcredemo.cpp. The
    makefile will automatically build these as well. Additional tests written
    for performance testing are in tests and have it's own makefile. 

One of the hardest and most interesting part of programming libraries is the
interface. This is a simple wrapper but the hard decisions were still in the
interface. My general philosophy is that I like C++ interfaces for their
potential convenience but C interfaces for their basic simplicity. C++
interfaces can have simplicity as well but they often get weighed down in
fanciness and in ad-hoc method bloat. I think this is often tied to the high
coupling of interface and implementation. Lastly, I did do performance tests
and I will publish the results and thoughts within the next few days.
