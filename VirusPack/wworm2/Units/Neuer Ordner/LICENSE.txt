PREAMBLE

The terms and conditions of the KOL&MCK

right as the sole distributor of the library 
source code. Hence although I encourage
you to change and modify the library to 
suit your needs, you may not distribute
derivative works based on the library
source code without express written 
permission from KOL&MCK Library author. 
Worthwhile changes and modifications to 
the libraries may be submitted to KOL&MCK
Library author for integration into a
future release of the product.
