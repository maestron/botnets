The only changes from Urxbot.sKull-Reptile.Mix is:

* the bot will not scan local nets.
* the scanstats will only output if it has rooted, and only
  show what was rooted.
* added pnp445.
* I changed scanall command a bit.  Before it would scan asn1http,
  asn1smb, and asn1smbnt, at 75 threads a piece.  I changed it so
  it would scan asn1http and pnp with 50 threads a piece.

This bot spreads pretty good, but it is unstable.
The problems I have ran across with this bot is:

* When I use encrypted strings in config, the bot will not
  try to load.
* There seems to be a problem with tftp, but ftp works fine.


I did not create this bot, I just added a few things and tried to
make it a little more stable.  For some reason when I update a few
bots to it, they will start spreading fine.  I see the rooted bots
joining, but I see the older bots quiting with "connection reset
by peer", so good luck with it. -gp
